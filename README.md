Landing Page exercise from the Odin Project

Odin Landing Page

This is my code for the Landing Page project in The Odin Project Foundations course.
Project Details

The Odin Project provided a webpage design that I needed to clone using HTML and CSS for the desktop. They also provided a style guide for colors and font sizes. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and getting various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.
Skills Learned

    Coming more comfortable with the CSS Flexbox model, especially justify-content and align-item rules
    Continuing to practice Git and Github project management
    Taking someone else's design and using HTML/CSS to make it happen
    Working on a project over multiple days and focusing on certain sections only
    

Here's what the exercise should look like:
