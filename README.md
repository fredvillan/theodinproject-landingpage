Landing Page exercise from the Odin Project

Odin Landing Page

This is my code for the Landing Page project in The Odin Project Foundations course.
Project Details

The Odin Project provided a webpage design that I needed to clone using HTML and CSS. I've used Google whenever I got stuck with styling and doing the exercise, coded it from 0 to the last line of codes.

PS: If anyone can check and give feedback on how my coding can be improved, please let me know. TIA :)
